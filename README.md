# Signed Frontend

**Signed Frontend** is a web-based application designed to display school schedules, events, and adzan (prayer call) notifications. This project focuses solely on the frontend, which is built using **Next.js** and integrates seamlessly with the backend powered by Laravel. The database is managed using MySQL and is deployed on a server for live access.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/signed-frontend.git

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
